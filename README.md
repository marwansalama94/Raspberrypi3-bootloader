# Raspberrypi3-bootloader

this is bootloader is originally created by dwelch67 i just modified it a little bit and used a script from CS107E repo which basically use xmodem lib in python and to transmit binary files over serial port and just added a single line to send b'g' cause i had already inserted my sdCard into the pi will change this later when i remove the sd.

don't forget to copy config.txt file to ur sdCard, u will also want the bootcode.bin and start.elf
